        <p>
            Welcome to my personal website!
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a 2020 Boston College graduate with majors in English and Communication. You may be wondering, how did I become interested in tech? 
            <br>
            <br>
            The first job I took out of college was as an intern at a creative brand and marketing agency in Soho, called SMAKK Studios. I grew a lot there in the course of a year and seven months, but eventually opted to leave for a more technical and less client centric role. I accepted a position as a Campaign Manager of Digital Ad Operations at Horizon Media. I loved how this more technical role suited my personality and made me feel comfortable in learning a skill and becoming a master of that specialty. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I have had this job now for 6 months, and I'm looking to take my career change from creative to technical a step further. While I love my role at Horizon as its helped me recognize that a technical role is a better fit for me, I am looking for something a bit more intellectually stimulating. So here I am, enrolled in a year program to learn to be a professional Software Engineer.
